WS-Trust (JAX-WS CXF STS Advanced sample)
=========================================

This sample illustrates some advanced concepts involving the STS. The basic
scenario is the same as the jaxws-cxf-sts sample, where a CXF SOAP Client (WSC)
invokes a CXF web service provider (WSP). Sample keystores and truststores
for the WSC, WSP, and STS are provided in this project but are of course not
meant for production use. The more advanced concepts are given as follows:

1.) The WSDL of the WSP (service/src/main/resources/DoubleIt.wsdl) defines an
IssuedToken policy that the WSC uses to obtain a security token from the STS
to access the WSP. The IssuedToken policy is defined as a
"SignedEncryptedSupportingTokens", meaning that the security token issued from
the STS must be signed and encrypted by the WSC, using the Symmetric binding
given. Secondly, the TokenType of the IssuedToken requires a wsse
UsernameToken to access the WSP.

2.) The WSC uses the Asymmetric binding to communicate with the STS, as
defined in the WSDL of the STS
(sts-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/DoubleItSTSService.wsdl). The second
advanced concept is that the STS does not ship with a TokenProvider to issue
UsernameTokens, as required by the WSP. A UsernameTokenProvider is provided
and installed in the list of TokenProviders of the STS. It uses the subject DN
of the WSC certificate as the username of the token, and a CallbackHandler
provides the corresponding password.

3.) Once the WSP receives the WSC request, and decrypts and verifies the
UsernameToken, it dispatches it for validation to the STS. It does this by
overriding the default validation mechanism which is to use a CallbackHandler
to supply a password which is then compared to the received password. This
validation request also demonstrates the token transformation feature of the
STS, as the WSP requests a SAML2 token type when validating the UsernameToken
that it has received.

4.) The Validate Operation of the STS is configured with a TokenValidator that
can validate UsernameTokens, and a SAML Token Provider. Once the received
UsernameToken is validated, a SAML Token is created due to the presence of a
SAML2 TokenType in the request from the WSP. A default
AttributeStatementProvider is registered with the SAMLTokenProvider, which
adds a "role" attribute in the generated token, the value of which depends on
the client principal.

5.) Finally, the WSP uses the role information in the SAML Token to see
whether the WSC is authorized to access the service. It does this by using a
custom AuthorizationInterceptor to retrieve the role, and compare it against a
list of authorized roles.

Important Note:  By default, this example uses strong encryption which is
recommended for use in production systems.  To run this example "out of the
box", you MUST have the "Java(TM) Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited
Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files" installed into your JRE. Note that the
unlimited strength policies are installed by default from the 1.8.0_161 release.
For prior java releases, the unlimited strength policy files can be obtained
from [1]:

[1] http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Alternatively, you can change to using a lower end encyption algorithm by
editing the security policies in:

client/src/main/resources/DoubleIt.wsdl
client/src/main/resources/DoubleItSTSService.wsdl
service/src/main/resources/DoubleIt.wsdl
service/src/main/resources/DoubleItSTSService.wsdl
sts/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/DoubleItSTSService.wsdl

to change from "Basic256" to "Basic128".   If you receive an error like
"Illegal key length" when running the demo, you need to change to Basic128 or
install the Unlimited Strength encryption libraries.

Usage
===============================================================================
Note: Please follow the parent README.txt first for common build and container
setup instructions.

How to Deploy:

1.) The STS and WSP can be deployed on either Tomcat (7.x or 6.x) or Karaf.

Tomcat deployment: If not already done, configure Maven to be able to install and
uninstall the WSP and the STS by following this section:
https://glenmazza.net/blog/entry/web-service-tutorial#maventomcat.  Also
start up Tomcat.

Note: If you wish to use Tomcat 6, use the -PTomcat6 flag when running the mvn
tomcat commands (tomcat:deploy, tomcat:redeploy, tomcat:undeploy).  (-PTomcat7
is active by default so does not need to be explicitly specified.)

From the root jaxws-cxf-sts-advanced folder, run "mvn clean install". If no
errors, can then run "mvn tomcat:deploy" (or tomcat:undeploy or
tomcat:redeploy on subsequent runs as appropriate), either from the same
folder (to deploy the STS and WSP at the same time) or separately, one at a
time, from the war and sts folders.

OSGi deployment: First run "mvn clean install" from the root jaxws-cxf-sts-advanced
folder.

   From the OSGi command line, run:
      karaf@trun> feature:install cxf-sts
      karaf@trun> feature:install talend-cxf-example-jaxws-cxf-sts-advanced-sts
      karaf@trun> feature:install talend-cxf-example-jaxws-cxf-sts-advanced-service

   (Make sure you've first installed the examples features repository as described in the
   parent README.)

For either Tomcat or OSGi deployment, before proceeding to the next step,
make sure you can view the following WSDLs:
CXF STS WSDL located at: http://localhost:8080/DoubleItSTS/X509?wsdl
CXF WSP: http://localhost:8080/doubleit/services/doubleit?wsdl

2.) Navigate to the client folder:

 * To run the client in a standalone manner, run mvn exec:exec.

 * Alternatively, it is possible to run the client from within the OSGi
   container.

   From the OSGi command line, run:
      karaf@trun> feature:install talend-cxf-example-jaxws-cxf-sts-advanced-client

You should see the results of the web service call.

For DEBUGGING:

1.) Check the logs directory under your Tomcat (catalina.log,
catalina(date).log in particular) or Karaf (data/log) folder for any errors
reported by the WSP or the STS.

2.) Use Wireshark to view messages:
