For source code download, OSGI-INF renamed to XOSGI-INF so it will be ignored by OSGI container and the information in the META-INF folder for Spring-DM used instead for configuration.

If you wish to use OSGI Blueprint configuration instead of Spring-DM, rename XOSGI-INF back to OSGI-INF and rename the META-INF folder to something else.
