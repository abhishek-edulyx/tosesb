JAX-RS JAX-WS Authorization Example
===================================

The demo shows how a single service instance can be exposed as either JAX-RS or JAX-WS
service at the same time and how CXF JAX-RS and JAX-WS proxies can reuse the same code for
invoking on the corresponding endpoints.

Additionally, it shows how a container-managed authentication can be used to populate a security context and how CXF authorization filters enforce the required authorization rules.

Building the Demo
---------------------------------------

This sample consists of 3 parts:
common/   - This directory contains the code that is common
            for both the client and the server.

service/  - This is where a HelloWorld service implementation shared by JAX-RS and JAX-WS endpoints as well as a JAX-RS authorization filter are located

war/      - This module creates a WAR archive containing the code from common and service modules.

client/   - This is a sample client application that shows how CXF JAX-RS and JAX-WS proxies are invoking on remote
            JAX-RS and JAX-WS endpoints represented by HelloWorld interface


From the base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is
located), the maven pom.xml file can be used to build and run the demo.


Usage
===============================================================================
Note: Please follow the parent README.txt first for common build and container
setup instructions.

Building:
---------
Using either Linux or Windows:  mvn install

Running this command will build the demo and create a WAR archive and an
OSGi bundle for deploying the service either to servlet or OSGi containers.

Starting the service
---------------------------------------
 * In the servlet container:

     cd war; mvn jetty:run

 * From within the TESB OSGi container:

   (Check if $KARAF_HOME/etc/users.properties file exists. If no then copy
   service-jaas/src/main/resources/users.properties to $KARAF_HOME/etc,
   otherwise add the content of service-jaas/src/main/resources/users.properties
   to the existing user.properties file.)

     karaf@trun> feature:install talend-cxf-example-jaxrs-jaxws-authorization

   (Make sure you've first installed the examples features repository as described in the
   parent README.)

Running the client
---------------------------------------

 * From the command line
   - cd client
   - mvn exec:java

By default, the client will use the http port 8080 for constructing the URIs.
This port value is set during the build in the client.properties resource file.
If the server is listening on the alternative port then you can use an 'http.port'
system property during the build:

- mvn install -Dhttp.port=8040

Demo Desciption
---------------

This demo shows how CXF security interceptors can be applied to individual endpoints
in order to enforce the RBAC authorization rules.

Note that :

- When a service is started in a war archive, the container-managed authentication is enforced
by the servlet container (Jetty). Please see WEB-INF/web.xml and main/src/resources/jetty-realm.properties
in the war module. The container will authenticate the current user and the information about the
current Principal and its roles will be accessible to CXF interceptors via the CXF SecurityContext.

- When a service is started from within the Talend ESB OSGi container, the authentication is enforced
by the BasicAuthJaasLoginInterceptor interceptor shipped with this demo.
This interceptor establishes a JAAS LoginContext session which is made accessible after the bundle created by
the service-jaas module build has been deployed. Next it creates a CXF SecurityContext from the
resulting Subject by relying on the convention that Principals having the names starting with the "ROLE_"
prefix identify the roles. This interceptor is only used in the OSGI deployments, see
META-INF/spring/beans.xml in the service module for more information.

- the JAX-WS endpoint uses a CXF SimpleAuthorizingInterceptor to enforce the authorization policy.

- the JAX-RS endpoint uses JAXRSSimpleAuthorizingInterceptor and JAXRSAuthorizationFilter shipped with this demo
in order to bypass the limitation of the current CXF SimpleAuthorizingInterceptor to do with it not recognizing
JAX-RS invocations. JAXRSSimpleAuthorizingInterceptor and JAXRSAuthorizationFilter will be dropped in the future
versions of this demo.

- the demo client verifies that "admin" users can access all the service methods and the "user" users can only
access a subset of them.
